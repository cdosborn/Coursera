A record of coding hw from Coursera classes

[Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang) by Dan Grossman

After taking the class (Jan 14th 2013), I ended up helping out as a Community TA for the next session. The course covers programming idioms in functional and object oriented programming, intensively delving into topics such as language interpretation and evaluation, recursion, mutation, typing systems, etc. The most rewarding element was the implementation of a language interpreter.
